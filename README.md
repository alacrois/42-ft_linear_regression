# ft_linear_regression
This is small machine learning project made in python.
The goal is to produce a predictive model (linear function) given a dataset using a gradient descent algorithm as training. See the subject for more infos.

The values for the model are contained in 'thetas' (starts at 0) and the dataset is 'data.csv'.
Execute train.py to train the model, the graph displayed represents the evolution of the model.
The black dots represents the dataset, the 3 lines represents the models at different stages of the gradient descent process (red=start, yellow=middle, green=end)
Close the window to end the program, the new thetas values have been saved.
Execute predict.py and enter an input (car mileage). The program outputs an estimated price based on the trained model.


Dependencies : Numpy & Matplotlib
